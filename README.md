# ðŸ§ª Early Detection of Diabetes â€“ An EDA Approach

## Problem Statement

Diabetes is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications like heart disease, kidney failure, and blindness. Early diagnosis and lifestyle adjustments can prevent or delay its onset.

In this project, we perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a real-world dataset from the **Pima Indian population**, which contains health-related features of women over the age of 21. Our goal is to:
- Understand the data distribution and detect missing or incorrect values.
- Explore feature relationships with the outcome variable (diabetes or not).
- Identify trends or indicators that may help predict diabetes risk.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, available on Kaggle:

## Project Steps

1.  **Loading the data:** Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Handling Missing Values:** Identify and handle missing values (represented as 0 in certain columns) by replacing them with NaN and then imputing them with the median of the respective columns.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   Analyze the distribution of the target variable ('Outcome').
    *   Visualize the distribution of key features like 'Age' and 'BMI'.
    *   Explore the relationship between features and the 'Outcome' variable using box plots (e.g., Glucose vs Outcome, Blood Pressure vs Outcome, Age vs Outcome).
    *   Generate a correlation heatmap to understand the relationships between all features.

## Summary of Insights

-   The dataset shows **class imbalance** in the target variable.
-   Diabetic individuals tend to have **higher Glucose, BMI, and Age**.
-   **Invalid zeros** in several features were handled by replacing them with NaN and then imputing with the median.
-   The **correlation heatmap** highlights important features for potential predictive modeling.

## Next Steps

Based on the EDA, you can now move forward to predictive modeling using various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, or any other classifier of your choice.
